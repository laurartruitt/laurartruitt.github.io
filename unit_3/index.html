		<h3>Our Story</h3>
			<p>Staying at home and quarantining during the COVID-19 pandemic, had a few pros! One of them being the birth of HomeBred. More than ever our skin is desperate for hydration from the overuse of washing hands and sanitizer. We take great pride in only using the finest ingredients to help with moisturizing. Our skin is our largest organ, so let's take care of it!
			<p>Baking bread has always been a goal of mine to do. Prior to the pandemic, I always made up excuses to bake. When you're at home ALL OF THE TIME with 2 kids, a husband, and dog, it gets repetitive very quickly! I quickly created my own sourdough starter which was just the beginning of an endless bread making opportunity. We specialize in sourdough bread and pizza dough! 
			<p>Do bread and salve belong together? Absolutely! Salve is very hydrating for your skin and sourdough, unlike traditional white and whole wheat breads, is more digestible and nutritious.
